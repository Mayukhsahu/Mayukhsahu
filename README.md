# Hello, I'm Mayukh Devan,
a part of a group of highly skilled developers at Impelox Tech.

I'm a passionate and curious full-stack developer with a love for crafting digital experiences. My journey in the world of technology began with a fascination for how software can shape the world around us. Over the years, I've honed my skills and embraced a holistic approach to web development.

## ðŸš€ What I Do

- **Frontend Magic**: I specialized in creating stunning and responsive user interfaces. Whether it's building web applications with Angular or React. I'm dedicated to crafting pixel-perfect designs.

- **Backend Wizardry**: My backend skills are sharpening day by day. I can feel the data types in my bones while writing type definitions in nest JS APIs and server-side applications.

- **Database Dynamo**: Databases are the heart of many applications, and I'm comfortable with both SQL and NoSQL databases. I feel satisfaction while building efficient data models and optimizing database queries.

## ðŸ’¡ What Drives Me

I'm fueled by the idea that technology can solve real-world problems. My passion lies in bridging the gap between concept and execution, turning ideas into functional and beautiful applications. While writing code, sometimes it's so satisfying that I hope it never endsðŸ˜€

## ðŸŒ± Always Learning

I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the ever-evolving tech landscape. I'm currently exploring Next js, and I'm excited to see how it can shape the future of software development.
